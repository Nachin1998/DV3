# From the Woods

Kayla is a very shy girl who gets bullied regularly by one of the older girls of her school. Her only comfort is her teddy Blue.
She gets regular night terrors because of the constant bullying, sometimes even Blue can't comfort her.
Even in her nightmares, her precious companion turns into a monster who haunts her in the deep, dark forest of her subconscious.
